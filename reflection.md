# STOP THINK WRITE

## 1. Steps in the design cycle
  - plan
  - design
  - develop
  - evaluate
  - implement

## 2. What is the purpose of the success criteria?
To determine and judge whether the finalized product meets the facotrs to be able to be identified as sufficient/high quality product. 
Lisitng out clear requirements to see if it meets the purpose of the program development, and whether the clients' needs are met.

## 3. What do you now understand about computer/computer science, that you did not know before Unit 1?
My new finding is that computer science is more than just knowing how to code.
Planning and understanding the porpose and aim contribute a lot to creating a quility peice of work. 

## 4. What do you understand now about yourself that you did not know before Unit 1?
I found out that I do not listen that much in class, because I had to keep on asking my peers on how to do certain things.
I also found out that I tend to think I understand when watching coding, but cannot code when I am told to do so.

## 5. What worked for you during the development of the Unit 1?
I was able to complete all necessary sections for the assessment.

## 6. What did not work for you during the development of the Unit 1?
I did not identify the success criterias good enough.
I did not justify enough about the choices of applications used for the project.
Manage time. 
Add more comments to make it more comprehendable for myself and others.

## 8. A developer is responsible only for the accomplishment of the success criteria. Do you agree or disagree? Defend your answer.
I belive developers must always look for possibilites to improve and build furthur than the success criteria, therefore, I believe developers should follow through with their project and revise and learn through feedback for future developments.
