## What do you now understand about computer/computer science, that you did not know before Unit 1?
My new finding is that computer science is more than just knowing how to code.
Planning and understanding the porpose and aim contribute a lot to creating a quility peice of work. 

## What do you understand now about yourself that you did not know before Unit 1?
I found out that I do not listen that much in class, because I had to keep on asking my peers on how to do certain things.
I also found out that I tend to think I understand when watching coding, but cannot code when I am told to do so.
